# HGL- HARKABAHADUR GRAPHICS LIBRARY
This is a simple graphics library created using OpenGL and GLUT.

This library creates lines, circles, ellipse, etc. using algorithms. Only point drawing function of OpenGL in immediate mode is used.
As the immediate mode is used, it is expected to be quite slow when rendering high end stuff.

This was basically created for 'Computer Graphics' project.
